## What is livecoding?

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding)

> Live coding (sometimes referred to as 'on-the-fly programming', 'just in time programming' and 'conversational programming') is a performing arts form and a creativity technique centred upon the writing of source code and the use of interactive programming in an improvised way.
